This repo holds the Lab 3 repository.

Lab 3 is a modified solution to chapter 6, programming problem 5.  The original text is as follows:

Text requirements
#################

Design and implement a class of postfix calculators.  Use the algorithm given in this chapter to evaluate
postfix expressions as entered into the calculator.  Use only the operators +, -, *, and /.  Assume that
the postfix expressions are syntactically correct.

Course specific requirements
############################

Name the program postfix.cpp. Make sure the following requirements are met. 

* Program must compile and run.
* Make sure to implement the algorithm (Evaluating Postfix Expressions 6.3.1) as a function. (not as part of main)
* Note while C does have the atoi function it may be easier to simply subtract the char '0' from the char digit.
